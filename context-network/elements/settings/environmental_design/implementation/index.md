# Implementation Methodology Index

## Purpose
This document indexes the practical application methodologies for environmental design frameworks, providing structured approaches for applying these concepts in narrative development.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Environment Design - Practical Application
- **Stability:** Established
- **Abstraction:** Procedural

## Categories

### Implementation Process
- [**Setting Analysis**](process/setting_analysis.md) - Techniques for analyzing setting requirements, classifying environment types, and determining narrative needs.
- [**Framework Selection**](process/framework_selection.md) - Methods for choosing appropriate frameworks and elements based on narrative goals.
- [**Environmental Development**](process/environmental_development.md) - Processes for creating fully realized environments with structural, atmospheric, and social elements.
- [**Narrative Integration**](process/narrative_integration.md) - Approaches for weaving environmental elements into story structure and character arcs.
- [**Review and Refinement**](process/review_and_refinement.md) - Evaluation techniques for assessing and improving environmental design effectiveness.

### Application Templates
- [**Urban Setting Development Template**](templates/urban_template.md) - Structured template for developing urban environments with all required elements.
- [**Rural Setting Development Template**](templates/rural_template.md) - Structured template for developing rural environments with all required elements.

### Environmental Design Checklists

- [**Rural Environment Checklist**](checklists/rural_checklist.md) - Comprehensive list for ensuring completeness of rural environment design.

## Overview

Implementation methodology provides practical processes, templates, and tools for applying environmental design frameworks to specific narrative projects. These methodologies help bridge the gap between theoretical understanding and practical application.

The implementation approach emphasizes:
- Structured analysis of narrative requirements
- Deliberate selection of appropriate frameworks
- Systematic development of environmental elements
- Intentional integration with narrative components
- Iterative review and refinement
