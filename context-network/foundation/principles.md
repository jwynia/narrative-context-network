### Narrative Design Principles

[List and describe the key principles that guide narrative design decisions]

1. **Character-Driven Storytelling**
   [Description of how character motivations, flaws, and growth drive narrative progression]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of character decisions driving plot, not plot driving character decisions]

2. **Meaningful Conflict**
   [Description of how conflict reveals character, advances plot, and explores theme]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of conflict serving multiple narrative purposes]

3. **World Consistency**
   [Description of how established rules, history, and culture create a believable framework]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of maintaining internal logic in worldbuilding]

4. **Purposeful Pacing**
   [Description of how rhythm of revelation, tension and release creates effective storytelling]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of pacing decisions serving story needs]

5. **Show, Don't Tell**
   [Description of how demonstrating through action and detail is preferred over exposition]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of revealing character or world through demonstration rather than explanation]

6. **Dimensional Characters**
   [Description of how complex, consistent yet evolving characters create engagement]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of character complexity in action]

7. **Narrative Economy**
   [Description of how every element serves multiple purposes in the story]
   
   *Example:* [Concrete example of efficient storytelling where elements serve multiple functions]

### Narrative Standards and Guidelines

[List and describe the storytelling standards and guidelines that the project adheres to]

#### Narrative Quality Standards

- **Clarity:** Story elements, character motivations, and plot progression must be understandable to the target audience
- **Consistency:** World rules, character behavior, and narrative logic must remain consistent
- **Purposefulness:** Every scene, character, and story element should serve the overall narrative
- **Originality:** Creative elements should avoid clich√©s and generic treatments
- **Emotional Impact:** Story elements should evoke intended emotional responses

#### Structural Standards

- **Coherent Structure:** The chosen narrative structure (three-act, hero's journey, etc.) should be consistently applied
- **Proper Setup and Payoff:** Elements introduced should have meaningful resolution
- **Scene Construction:** Scenes should have clear purpose, changing at least one story element
- **Transitions:** Movement between scenes, settings, and viewpoints should be smooth and comprehensible
- **Pacing Variation:** Rhythm should vary appropriately to serve story needs

#### Audience Consideration Standards

- **Appropriate Content:** Material should align with target audience age range and expectations
- **Accessibility:** Narrative should be accessible to intended audience without requiring external knowledge
- **Engagement:** Content should maintain audience interest through hooks, questions, and tension
- **Reward:** Audience investment should be rewarded with satisfying development and resolution
- **Respect:** Treatment of sensitive topics should be thoughtful and appropriate

#### Medium-Specific Standards

- **Novel/Short Story:** Prose quality, voice consistency, and effective description
- **RPG:** Player agency, balanced participation, and session pacing
- **Interactive Fiction:** User choice meaningfulness, navigation clarity, and feedback
- **Narrative Game:** Integration of mechanics with story, player guidance, and responsive storytelling

### Creative Process Principles

[List and describe the principles that guide narrative development processes]

1. **Intentional Creation**
   [Description of how deliberate decisions about story elements create stronger narratives]

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   [Description of how multiple revisions, feedback cycles, and testing improve narrative quality]

3. **Audience Awareness**
   [Description of how understanding target audience needs and expectations guides creative decisions]

4. **Collaboration and Synthesis**
   [Description of how diverse creative inputs and feedback create stronger narrative outcomes]

5. **Balance of Planning and Discovery**
   [Description of how combining structured planning with creative exploration produces optimal results]

### Narrative Decision-Making Framework

[Describe the framework used for making creative and storytelling decisions in the project]

#### Narrative Decision Criteria

- **Creative Vision Alignment:** Does the decision support the core creative vision?
- **Story Purpose:** Does the decision serve the story's intended purpose and themes?
- **Character Authenticity:** Is the decision true to established character traits and arcs?
- **World Consistency:** Does the decision maintain the integrity of the established world?
- **Audience Impact:** Will the decision create the intended effect for the audience?
- **Medium Suitability:** Does the decision work effectively in the chosen medium?

#### Narrative Trade-off Considerations

- **Clarity vs. Subtlety:** When to directly explain versus when to suggest or imply
- **Familiarity vs. Originality:** When to use recognizable elements versus novel concepts
- **Character vs. Plot:** When to prioritize character integrity versus plot requirements
- **Efficiency vs. Immersion:** When to compress story versus when to expand experience
- **Realism vs. Entertainment:** When to adhere to realistic constraints versus dramatic effect
- **Complexity vs. Accessibility:** When to develop intricate elements versus maintain simplicity

### Storytelling Principle Application

[Describe how these storytelling principles should be applied in practice]

#### When Narrative Principles Conflict

When storytelling principles come into conflict, consider:

1. **Hierarchy of Purpose:** Prioritize principles based on the specific goal of the scene or story element
2. **Audience Impact:** Choose the approach that will have the most effective impact on the audience
3. **Story Phase:** Different principles may take precedence at different stages of the narrative
4. **Medium Requirements:** Some principles carry different weight depending on the narrative format
5. **Creative Vision:** Ultimate creative direction should resolve conflicts when other methods don't provide clear guidance

#### Contextual Application of Principles

Every principle should be applied with consideration for:

1. **Genre Conventions:** How genre expectations might modify application of principles
2. **Target Audience:** How audience characteristics influence principle implementation
3. **Medium Constraints:** How the delivery format affects principle application
4. **Narrative Tone:** How the intended tone requires adjustment of principles
5. **Project Scope:** How the scale of the project influences principle priorities

#### Exceptions to Principles

These principles may be mindfully broken when:

1. **Intentional Subversion:** Deliberately challenging expectations for specific effect
2. **Genre Requirements:** Meeting genre-specific needs that contradict general principles
3. **Experimental Approaches:** Testing innovative narrative techniques
4. **Medium-Specific Needs:** Adapting to constraints or opportunities of the chosen format
5. **Audience Consideration:** Adjusting for specific audience needs or limitations
