# Narrative Context Network Navigation Guide

## Overview

This context network contains all planning documents, conceptual work, and coordination information for narrative projects including novels/series, short stories, RPG games and modules, narrative games, interactive fiction, and other storytelling projects. It is organized into several key sections to facilitate navigation and information discovery for worldbuilding and narrative development.

## Structure

The narrative context network is organized as follows:

## Classification System

Information nodes in this context network are classified along these dimensions:

1. **Domain**: [Primary knowledge area]
   - Examples: Core Concept, Supporting Element, External Factor, Resource, Output
   - Project-specific examples might include: Research, Design, Content, Process, Outcome

2. **Stability**: [Change frequency expectation]
   - Static: Fundamental principles unlikely to change
   - Semi-stable: Established patterns that evolve gradually
   - Dynamic: Frequently changing information

3. **Abstraction**: [Detail level]
   - Conceptual: High-level ideas and principles
   - Structural: Organizational patterns and frameworks
   - Detailed: Specific implementations and examples

4. **Confidence**: [Information reliability]
   - Established: Verified and reliable information
   - Evolving: Partially validated but subject to refinement
   - Speculative: Exploratory ideas requiring validation
