### [Composition & Staging](composition_and_staging.md)
The deliberate arrangement of environmental elements to guide attention, create visual pathways, and establish narrative focus.

### [Multi-sensory Engagement](multi_sensory_engagement.md)
The integration of visual, auditory, tactile, olfactory, and kinesthetic elements to create immersive environments.

### [Environmental Personification](environmental_personification.md)
The development of settings with distinct "personalities" that influence and reflect narrative elements.

### [Emotional Resonance](emotional_resonance.md)
The deliberate design of environments to evoke specific emotional responses that enhance narrative impact.

## Overview

These core design principles form the foundation for all environmental design in narrative contexts, regardless of whether the setting is urban, rural, or hybrid. They represent universal approaches to creating environments that actively participate in storytelling rather than serving as mere backdrops.

Effective implementation of these principles enables environments to:
- Guide reader/audience attention to significant narrative elements
- Create immersive experiences that engage multiple senses
- Establish setting as an active narrative participant with its own "character"
- Evoke specific emotional responses that enhance story impact
