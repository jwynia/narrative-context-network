## Purpose
This document previously provided specialized frameworks for developing urban and rural settings within narrative contexts. The content has been reorganized into a hierarchical structure based on the context network's file size management guidelines.

## New Structure

The environmental design frameworks are now organized as follows:

- [**Environmental Design Index**](environmental_design/index.md) - Main entry point with overview and navigation
- [**Core Design Principles**](environmental_design/core_principles/index.md) - Foundational principles for all environmental design
- [**Urban Environmental Design Framework**](environmental_design/urban_frameworks/index.md) - Specialized frameworks for urban settings
- [**Rural Environmental Design Framework**](environmental_design/rural_frameworks/index.md) - Specialized frameworks for rural settings
- [**Impact on Narrative Elements**](environmental_design/narrative_impact/index.md) - Analysis of environmental design's influence on narrative
- [**Implementation Methodology**](environmental_design/implementation/index.md) - Practical application guidance and templates
