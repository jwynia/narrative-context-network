### Key Narrative Elements

#### World
[Description of the world/universe, its fundamental rules, history, and key characteristics. This encompasses the complete setting in which the narrative takes place.]

#### Characters
[Description of characters as narrative elements, their purposes, archetypes, and development patterns. This defines how characters function within the narrative structure.]

#### Plot
[Description of plot structure, including key events, turning points, and narrative progression. This defines how the story unfolds.]

#### Settings
[Description of specific locations, environments, and their narrative significance. These are distinct places within the overall world.]

#### Themes
[Description of thematic elements, motifs, and symbolic frameworks that provide meaning and depth to the narrative.]

#### Arcs
[Description of character and plot arcs, their progression patterns, and resolution approaches.]

#### Events
[Description of significant narrative events, their causality, and impact on the story progression.]

#### Mechanics (for games/interactive fiction)
[Description of gameplay or interactive elements, their integration with narrative, and player/reader agency.]

### Narrative Element Interactions

#### Character-World Interactions
[Describe how characters are shaped by and influence the world, including cultural background, historical context, and environmental adaptation]

#### Setting-Plot Interactions
[Describe how settings influence plot events and how the plot moves through different settings]

#### Character-Plot Interactions
[Describe how characters drive plot and how plot events transform characters]

#### Theme-Element Interactions
[Describe how thematic elements manifest across characters, settings, and plot]

#### Mechanics-Narrative Interactions (for games/interactive fiction)
[Describe how game/interactive mechanics reinforce narrative elements and how narrative justifies mechanical systems]

### Narrative Frameworks and Methods

| Narrative Area | Frameworks/Methods | Application |
|-------|--------------|---------------|
| Plot Structure | [Hero's Journey, Three-Act Structure, Five-Act Structure, etc.] | [How these frameworks are applied to the project] |
| Character Development | [Character Arc Types, Personality Systems, etc.] | [How these frameworks shape character creation and evolution] |
| Worldbuilding | [Cultural Construction, Historical Development, etc.] | [How these methods create coherent and believable worlds] |
| Theme Exploration | [Motif Development, Symbol Systems, etc.] | [How these approaches reinforce thematic depth] |
| Setting Creation | [Environmental Storytelling, Location Design, etc.] | [How these methods create meaningful spaces] |
| Mechanics (for games) | [Player Agency Models, Risk/Reward Systems, etc.] | [How these systems enhance narrative experience] |

### Narrative Success Criteria

#### Coherence
[Description of narrative coherence requirements and how the structure creates a unified story experience]

#### Engagement
[Description of audience engagement goals and how the structure creates and maintains interest]

#### Emotional Impact
[Description of emotional impact objectives and how the structure delivers meaningful experiences]

#### Thematic Resonance
[Description of thematic depth requirements and how the structure conveys meaningful ideas]

#### Memorability
[Description of memorable moment creation and how the structure delivers standout experiences]

#### Pacing and Flow
[Description of rhythm requirements and how the structure manages tension and release]

#### World Consistency
[Description of worldbuilding consistency requirements and how the structure maintains believability]

#### Character Authenticity
[Description of character realism/believability requirements and how the structure creates compelling personalities]

### Creation Approach

[Description of how the narrative will be developed, including creative phases, iteration cycles, and feedback processes]

```

### Narrative Evolution

[Description of how the narrative structure might evolve over time, including sequel potential, world expansion, and character development opportunities]

### Documentation Structure

The narrative elements are documented in dedicated sections of the context network:
