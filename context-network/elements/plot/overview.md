### Plot Development Philosophy

[Describe the overall approach to plot development for this narrative project, including the balance between planning and discovery, structural frameworks, and purpose of plot elements]

### Plot Architecture

#### Plot Scales

```mermaid
graph TD
    MP[Master Plot] --> MJ[Major Arcs/Storylines]
    MJ --> MP1[Plot Threads]
    MP1 --> SQ[Sequences]
    SQ --> SC[Scenes]

### Plot Structural Frameworks

[List and describe the plot structural frameworks applicable to this narrative project]

#### Primary Structure
[Describe the main structural framework being used (e.g., Three-Act Structure, Hero's Journey, Five-Act Structure, etc.)]

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Act 1: Setup] --> B[Act 2: Confrontation]
    B --> C[Act 3: Resolution]
    
    subgraph "Act 1"
    A1[Exposition] --> A2[Inciting Incident]
    A2 --> A3[First Threshold]
    end
    
    subgraph "Act 2"
    B1[Rising Action] --> B2[Midpoint]
    B2 --> B3[Complications]
    B3 --> B4[Low Point]
    end
    
    subgraph "Act 3"
    C1[Final Push] --> C2[Climax]
    C2 --> C3[Denouement]
    end
