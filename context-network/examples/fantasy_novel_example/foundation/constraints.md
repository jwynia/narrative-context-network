# Project Constraints: The Fractured Realms

## Purpose
This document defines the creative, technical, external, and intentional constraints that will guide the development of "The Fractured Realms" fantasy novel.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Core Parameters
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

## Content

### Creative Constraints

#### Genre Conventions
- **Fantasy Genre Adherence:** The project will adhere to core high fantasy conventions including:
  - Secondary world setting (no connection to Earth)
  - Magic as a fundamental element of the world
  - Epic scope with high stakes (world/multiverse preservation)
  - Hero's journey narrative structure with adaptations
- **Genre Subversions:** The project will intentionally subvert:
  - The "chosen one" trope (protagonist is skilled but not prophesied)
  - Black and white morality (antagonists have legitimate perspectives)
  - Single culture dominance (multiple equal civilizations)

#### Worldbuilding Limits
- **Realm Count Constraint:** The narrative will focus on 5 distinct realms to maintain clarity
- **Physical Law Consistency:** Each realm must have internally consistent physical/magical laws
- **Boundary Mechanics:** Clear rules for how realm boundaries work and can be traversed
- **Magic System Limitations:** Each realm's magic has specific costs, limitations, and logical consequences
- **Technology Level Cap:** No realm will exceed late-medieval/early-renaissance technology

#### Narrative Boundaries
- **Content Restrictions:** 
  - Violence will be present but not gratuitous or glorified
  - No sexual violence or exploitation
  - No explicit sexual content (implied/fade to black approach)
- **Thematic Restrictions:**
  - Avoid simplistic "evil for evil's sake" antagonist motivations
  - Avoid cultural appropriation of real-world cultures
  - Avoid heavy-handed moral messaging

#### Stylistic Parameters
- **Voice:** Third-person limited perspective, primarily following Elara
- **Tone:** Serious with moments of levity, philosophical but accessible
- **Prose Style:** Clear, evocative, with moderate description density
- **Dialogue Approach:** Character-distinct speech patterns that reflect realm origins

### Technical Constraints

#### Medium Limitations
- **Word Count Range:** 110,000-130,000 words
- **Chapter Structure:** 20-25 chapters of roughly equal length
- **POV Limitation:** Single primary POV with possible prologue/epilogue exceptions
- **Format Requirements:** Standard manuscript format for potential traditional publishing

#### Production Requirements
- **Writing Software:** Manuscript to be created in standard word processing software
- **Revision Capability:** Document format must support tracked changes/comments
- **Reference Management:** Worldbuilding bible must be easily accessible during writing

#### Distribution Considerations
- **Publishing Path Options:** Manuscript will be prepared for both traditional and self-publishing paths
- **Series Potential:** Narrative must work as standalone but allow for series continuation
- **Market Differentiation:** Final product must have clear unique selling points within fantasy genre

### External Constraints

#### Audience Expectations
- **Reader Familiarity:** Acknowledge common fantasy reader background knowledge
- **Trope Management:** Use familiar elements but avoid clich√© implementations
- **Pacing Expectations:** Begin with strong hook and maintain contemporary pacing
- **Resolution Requirements:** Provide satisfying conclusion even within series framework

#### Market Considerations
- **Current Fantasy Trends:** Incorporate elements of character-driven fantasy and complex morality
- **Comp Title Differentiation:** Ensure distinctiveness from recent similar titles
- **Series Potential:** Structure for possible trilogy without requiring continuation

#### Timeline Constraints
- **Draft Completion:** First draft within 6 months
- **Revision Timeline:** Complete revisions within 3 months after draft completion
- **Final Preparation:** Ready for submission/publication within 10 months total

#### Resource Limitations
- **Solo Development:** Primary writing and worldbuilding by single author
- **Research Scope:** Research limited to accessible resources (no field research)
- **Feedback Resources:** Limited to writing group and 2-3 beta readers

### Intentional Constraints

#### Self-Imposed Challenges
- **Single POV Constraint:** Tell the story through one primary character despite multiple realms
- **Magic System Rules:** Create distinctive magic for each realm that maintains logical consistency
- **Multi-thread Plot Restriction:** Maintain no more than three concurrent plot threads

#### Experimental Parameters
- **Realm Language Parameters:** Develop linguistic markers for each realm without creating full conlangs
- **Moral Complexity Challenge:** Create antagonists with legitimate philosophical positions
- **Perspective Visualization Experiment:** Develop techniques to show how reality perception differs between realms
