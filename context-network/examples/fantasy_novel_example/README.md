# Fantasy Novel Example Project

This directory contains a sample implementation of a fantasy novel project using the narrative context network. It demonstrates how to apply the various frameworks, templates, and processes to create a cohesive narrative project.

## Example Overview

This example illustrates the development of a fantasy novel titled "The Fractured Realms" using the context network's frameworks and processes. The example includes:

1. Initial project setup using the Project Initialization Process
2. Application of worldbuilding frameworks for a fantasy setting
3. Character development using the naming and development frameworks
4. Plot construction using scene-building and fantasy genre frameworks
5. Demonstration of framework selection and implementation

## Purpose

This example serves several purposes:

- **Demonstration**: Shows how the abstract frameworks translate into practical narrative development
- **Learning Resource**: Provides a reference for users starting their own projects
- **Template**: Can be used as a starting point and modified for similar projects
- **Workflow Example**: Illustrates effective workflow using the context network

## How to Use This Example

1. **Explore the Structure**: Notice how the example follows the context network organization pattern
2. **Review the Process**: See how the project initialization process was applied
3. **Examine Framework Application**: Study how specific frameworks were selected and implemented
4. **Compare to Your Project**: Use as a reference when developing similar fantasy narratives
5. **Adapt as Needed**: Modify concepts and approaches for your own project

## Key Files to Examine

- `foundation/project_definition.md` - See how the project was defined using the template
- `foundation/constraints.md` - Example of establishing creative boundaries
- `elements/world/overview.md` - Demonstration of worldbuilding framework application
- `elements/characters/overview.md` - Example of character design using the frameworks
- `elements/plot/overview.md` - Example plot structure using appropriate frameworks
- `planning/llm_workflow.md` - Example of planned interactions with AI assistants

## Limitations

This example is intentionally simplified to demonstrate framework application clearly. A full novel project would contain more detailed development of all elements.
