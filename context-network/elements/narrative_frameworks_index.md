- **Worldbuilding → Character Development:**
  - Cultural frameworks inform character naming and background
  - World rules constrain character capabilities and challenges
  - Historical development shapes character perspectives

- **Character → Plot Development:**
  - Character traits drive believable plot decisions
  - Character naming reinforces narrative themes
  - Character arcs intertwine with plot progression

- **Plot → Worldbuilding:**
  - Plot events reveal world elements organically
  - World consistency shapes plot possibilities
  - Setting-specific scenes enhance world depth

5. Apply frameworks with appropriate adaptations for genre and medium

#### Cross-Framework Workflows

**World-to-Character-to-Plot Workflow:**
1. Use GRAPES Framework to establish world foundations
2. Apply Cultural Development Framework to create distinctive cultures
3. Use Cultural Naming Pattern Template for consistent character naming
4. Apply Character-Name Resonance Framework for meaningful character names
5. Use Story Circle Framework to develop character journeys within world
6. Apply Scene Purpose Framework to create scenes that reveal characters and world

**Plot-to-Character-to-World Workflow:**
1. Begin with Dramatic Arc Framework to establish overall narrative shape
2. Use Value Shift Framework to identify core value conflicts
3. Apply Character-Name Resonance Framework to develop characters that embody these values
4. Use Character-Centric Worldbuilding to expand world from character experience
5. Apply Historical Layering to develop world context that supports plot
6. Use Scene-Sequel Framework to develop scene progression
