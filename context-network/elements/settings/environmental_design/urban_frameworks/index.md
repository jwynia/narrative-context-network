# Urban Environmental Design Framework Index

## Purpose
This document indexes the specialized frameworks for developing urban settings within narrative contexts.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Environment Design - Urban Settings
- **Stability:** Established
- **Abstraction:** Methodological
- **Confidence:** Evidence-based

## Categories

### Structural Elements
- [**Density and Verticality**](structural/density_and_verticality.md) - The concentration of structures with vertical expansion, creating layered physical and social spaces.
- [**Grid Systems and Disruption**](structural/grid_systems.md) - The planned organization of urban spaces with deliberate interruptions that create narrative tension.
- [**Boundaries and Thresholds**](structural/boundaries_and_thresholds.md) - The delineation between urban districts that create natural story transition points and reflect social divisions.

### Atmospheric Elements
- [**Technological Integration**](atmospheric/technological_integration.md) - The embedding of technology within urban environments as both functional and symbolic elements.
- [**Sensory Density**](atmospheric/sensory_density.md) - The concentration of sensory inputs creating distinctive urban experiential landscapes.
- [**Artificial Lighting**](atmospheric/artificial_lighting.md) - The deliberate manipulation of light sources to create mood, guide attention, and establish temporal context.

### Social Elements
- [**Crowds and Anonymity**](social/crowds_and_anonymity.md) - The presence or absence of dense human activity as a narrative element.
- [**Social Friction Points**](social/social_friction_points.md) - Locations where different social groups interact, creating natural settings for conflict and character development.
- [**Visible Infrastructure**](social/visible_infrastructure.md) - The physical manifestation of societal systems that reveal power structures and organizational principles.

## Overview

Urban environmental design frameworks provide specialized approaches for developing settings that capitalize on the unique characteristics of cities, towns, and other densely populated areas. These frameworks address the distinctive narrative opportunities and challenges presented by urban environments.

Urban settings are characterized by:
- High density human habitation and activity
- Significant human modification of the natural environment
- Complex layering of historical, social, and functional elements
- Pronounced vertical dimensionality
- Technological integration and infrastructure systems
- Diverse social interactions and anonymous encounters
