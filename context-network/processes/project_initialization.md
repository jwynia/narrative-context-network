# Project Initialization Process

## Purpose
This document provides a structured process for initializing new narrative projects within the context network. It guides users through defining project parameters, establishing constraints, and setting up the necessary foundation before beginning creative development.

## Classification
- **Domain:** Process
- **Stability:** Semi-stable
- **Abstraction:** Structural
- **Confidence:** Established

### Project Initialization Overview

Effective narrative projects begin with clear definition and structural planning. This initialization process guides you through setting up your project in the context network with appropriate scope, goals, and constraints.

## Scale and Scope
- **Project Size:** [Single work, series, universe, etc.]
- **Timeline:** [Expected development timeline]

```

### 2. Constraint Definition Framework

Define your project constraints in your `foundation/constraints.md` file using this framework:

```markdown
# Project Constraints

## Creative Constraints
- **Genre Conventions:** [Required/expected elements for your genre]
- **Worldbuilding Limits:** [Technological, magical, physical rules]
- **Narrative Boundaries:** [Topics, themes, or plot elements to avoid]
- **Stylistic Parameters:** [Voice, tone, stylistic choices]

## Technical Constraints
- **Medium Limitations:** [Constraints of your chosen medium]
- **Production Requirements:** [Technical specifications]
- **Distribution Considerations:** [How the work will reach audiences]

## External Constraints
- **Audience Expectations:** [Consideration of audience needs/sensitivities]
- **Market Considerations:** [Commercial requirements if applicable]
- **Timeline Constraints:** [Deadlines, milestones]
- **Resource Limitations:** [Budget, team size, tools]

## Intentional Constraints
- **Self-Imposed Challenges:** [Constraints added for creative reasons]
- **Experimental Parameters:** [Areas where you're trying new approaches]
```

### 3. Framework Selection Guide

Use this decision tree to select appropriate frameworks for your project from the narrative context network:

#### Worldbuilding Framework Selection

1. Identify your narrative's worldbuilding needs:
   - Historical/realistic setting → Historical Layering Framework
   - Fantasy/speculative setting → Magic System + GRAPES Framework
   - Science fiction setting → Technology Integration + GRAPES Framework
   - Contemporary setting → Cultural Development Framework

2. Determine world scope:
   - Limited location focus → Character-Centric Worldbuilding
   - Expansive world → Full GRAPES Framework
   - Abstracted/conceptual → Economy of Invention + Familiar-Strange Balance

3. For specialized elements, add:
   - Magical elements → Magic System Development Framework
   - Multiple cultures → Cultural Development Framework
   - Environmental focus → Ecological Worldbuilding Framework
   - Economic themes → Economic System Development Framework
   - Religious elements → Religious System Development Framework
   - Language importance → Linguistic Development Framework

#### Character Framework Selection

1. Identify character naming approach:
   - Historical/cultural basis → Cultural Coherence + Historical Fiction Authenticity
   - Fantasy/invented → Phonological Significance + Fantasy Name Cliché Assessment
   - Science fiction → Science Fiction Name Evolution Framework
   - Contemporary → Sociological Naming System

2. Test selected approach with:
   - Pronunciation Testing
   - Association Testing
   - Distinctiveness Testing
   - Consistency Testing

#### Plot Framework Selection

1. Identify primary narrative structure:
   - Character transformation → Story Circle Framework
   - Complex/multiple storylines → Multiple Storyline Framework
   - Thematic exploration → Value Shift Framework
   - Action-driven → Dramatic Arc Framework

2. Add specialized elements as needed:
   - Genre-specific elements → Appropriate Genre-Specific Plot Framework
   - Cross-cultural influences → Cross-Cultural Storytelling Frameworks
   - Interactive elements → Interactive Narrative Frameworks
   - Digital media integration → Digital-Era Narrative Frameworks
   - Visual storytelling → Visual Storytelling Frameworks

3. For scene development:
   - Standard scene construction → Scene-Sequel Framework
   - High emotional impact → Scene Tension + Emotional Resonance Mapping
   - Setting-driven scenes → Scene Setting Integration Framework
   - Dialogue-focused scenes → Scene Dialogue Effectiveness Framework

### 4. Project Structure Setup

Create the following initial structure in your context network:

1. **Foundation Layer:**
   - Complete project_definition.md
   - Create constraints.md
   - Establish project_principles.md with core narrative values

2. **Elements Layer - Initial Setup:**
   - Create world/overview.md with world concept
   - Create characters/overview.md with character approach
   - Create plot/overview.md with structural approach

3. **Planning Layer:**
   - Create roadmap.md with development milestones
   - Create research_needs.md to identify required research

### 5. Narrative Seeds Template

Use this template to create initial narrative seeds in `elements/narrative_seeds.md`:

```markdown
# Narrative Seeds
