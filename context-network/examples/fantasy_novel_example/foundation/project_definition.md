## Core Concept
The Fractured Realms is a high fantasy novel set in a world where reality has been shattered into multiple overlapping domains, each with its own physical and magical laws. After centuries of isolation, the barriers between realms are weakening, causing catastrophic events and unexpected opportunities. The story follows Elara, a boundary walker with the rare ability to cross between realms, as she assembles an unlikely alliance from different domains to prevent the complete collapse of the multiverse structure. The narrative explores how people with fundamentally different realities and worldviews can find common ground when faced with mutual extinction.
